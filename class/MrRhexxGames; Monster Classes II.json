This is the fact that true dragons become stronger the older they get, seemingly without any limitation.",
								"The power that a dragon obtains upon aging is unlike that of any other monster, for this power is not reserved exclusively to muscular might. A dragon’s brain enlarges as it grows older, making the dragon more intelligent over time. Its magical blood becomes denser and purer, granting the creature more powerful innate magics as it grows older; its scales grow thicker, its claws larger, its eyesight clearer, and its ears and nose more discerning. The oldest dragons are among the most powerful creatures in the world, able to contend with even demon lords."

								"Even though many dragons have their own reasons for doing so, all of them desire and hoard wealth, collecting massive mounds of treasure and dedicating their existence to protecting it. Most dragons consider the brilliance of precious gems and the value of coins to be worthy of their treasure hoard. However, what a dragon would consider “treasure” shifts dramatically depending on the kind of dragon in question. There are dragons who collect precious tomes of lore and history, while there are others who prefer the pleasant sight of a perfectly sculpted set of statues as treasure.",
								"Because of the immense value of a dragon’s treasure hoard, it is never safe from thieves. So dragons go to any lengths necessary to secure the protection of their wealth. Some dragons hire minions to safeguard their lair, while others go so far as to magically trap entire rooms against tampering. Since fear of having their treasure stolen never relents, and many give way to their neuroticism, dragons often end up sleeping atop their own piles of money, often recounting every coin before and after rest."

Less commonly, this is also seen as a change in the fauna, flora, and elemental properties of the area in which the dragon resides.",
								"Because of the inherent magical power of the draconic body, dragons often find themselves the targets of adventuring groups who seek to slay them; if not for their wealth, then for either their scales or organs. Many humanoid groups have made the ritualistic imbibing of draconic blood a customary tradition in order to obtain the might of dragons, while others dress themselves in the powerful scales of slain wyrms. Experienced sages and wizards often seek esoteric parts of the draconic body in order to fuel dark spells of incredible potency."

This class entry describes and provides options for metallic dragons: brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver.",

In general, metallic dragons are considered to be morally good, noble in demeanor, and respected by wise humanoids.

						"The dragon class featured here is at the ripe age for adventuring. Being between the ages of 50 to 100, your dragon has probably just recently left the territory of its parents and begun its journey to find and claim its own. The lengthy process of finding the perfect lair can take decades however, since a dragon has to examine each individual region for enemies which may contest its superiority.",
						"In this particular age group of dragonkind, your dragon would have just entered young adulthood, which is a special time for every dragon. It is not just the time when it searches for a territory, but it is also at this time when the desire to mate begins. Many dragons start an extensive search for a prospective long-term partner at this time, though they seldom settle until after their first century. It is also through the dawning of adulthood when dragons start innately developing their first spells, including their ability to polymorph—which at this point is still fairly limited.",
						"When you create your dragon, consider that this is meant to be the adventurous spate of its life. As every dragon knows, as soon as it collects enough treasure and finds a suitable territory, it will become increasingly difficult to leave it. Up until this point, it might have lived its entire life stuck in a lair with all its brothers and sisters or living alone with its mother atop a great mountain. Consider that dragons teach their children much about the world, but that still doesn’t change the fact that your dragon has probably never seen much of what the world has to offer.

								"Some of these meetups can turn ugly from the very beginning—primarily when encountering chromatic dragons—which result in a constant fear of sudden, deadly ambushes. The delicate dance of territorial aggression in these encounters can last for many decades, generally only ending in the death of one or both dragons in brutal combat. Many draconic alliances are formed and mercenaries are bribed during these confrontations.",
								"When building your dragon, think about how your presence has shifted the delicate balance between all the other dragons in the area. Remember that no dragon will simply hand-wave the existence of another in its territory without strong consideration, since every single dragon will eventually grow to become a terror; it’s always only a matter of time.
